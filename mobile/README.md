# Mobile App

This directory contains the React Native mobile application built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npm start
```

Running `npm start` opens Expo Dev Tools in your browser. From there you can run the app on an Android or iOS simulator, or on a physical device with the Expo Go app.

## Testing

Run unit tests with Jest:

```bash
npm test
```
